Assembly with Shasta
if fails, remove the --assemblyDirectory line (only allowed in command line)
note: tutorial uses himem node for shasta, but that job have never began, using himem2 started it immediately.

Assembly with Flye
* genome size estimate can be rough (used 150m)
* to select 2-4 lines of fastq file and write it as fasta

Goal: uncompress the archive -- looks like it finally worked!
tar -xzf ./2021FEB08_Terlova_AlgPool_PAG49760.tar.gz
# I think with z flag even my initial line that specified that I only want fastq files would have worked
# the job took 8 hours

Goal: run centrifuge script on ZA17 (barcode01) reads

(ERR): centrifuge-class died with signal 6 (ABRT) 

Goal: run nanoplot for initial QC
ZA17-initial-summary-plots-log-transformed -- for the pre-centrifuge fastq files basecalled by the fast method

# reason that these jobs failed is that my unarchiving corrupted the fastq files

March 16, 2021

Goal: run centrifuge script on ZA17 (barcode01) reads

1) put all barcode01 fastq files into one file called ZA17_all.fastq (prints Completed for each file it processes, 172 files processed)
for i in `ls *.fastq`; do cat $i >> ZA17_all.fastq; echo "Completed"; done

Question: is there a way to check how did it do?

Unzipped the fastq files from the original tar.gz folder that came from the sequencer
somewhat successful, unzipping worked, but the new folder was put into the folder with the archive instead of the specified one.

The unzipped folder has the following structure:

2021FEB08_Terlova_AlgPool_PAG49760
 2021FEB08_Terlova_AlgPool_PAG49760
  20210208_1948_2G_PAG49760_11f79328
   fastq_pass
    barcode01
     *many fastq files
    barcode09
     *one fastq file
    barcode05
     *one fastq file
    barcode03
     *many fastq files
    unclassified

    barcode07
     *one fastq file
    barcode04
     *one fastq file
    barcode02
     *many fastq file

Questions:
- why there are more than 3 barcodes?
- what to do with the unclassified reads?
